# Build/download Example

This example can not be moved to other directory unless the example project configuration is modified.

Building the example project can refer to document *AN154 GD32VW553 Quick Development Guide.docx*.

* start GD32EclipseIDE, import example project, select the directory living.
* configure ToolChain and Build Tool.
* build project, after compilation the image will be saved in the directory MSDK\examples\combo\gatt_mqtts_https\image.bin
* use GDLINK/JLINK or dragging it into the USB disk to download image.


# Using Example

If BLE_ROLE is BLE_CENTRAL, after power up, start board ble will scan and try to connect to device which sending adv data with device name.

If BLE_ROLE is BLE_PERIPHERAL, after power up, start board will directly send advertising whose adv data include device name.

Both BLE_CENTRAL and BLE_PERIPHERAL, the WiFi will try to connect with the configured SSID. After WiFi connected, it will try to connect with MQTTS server and then HTTPS server.

Power up both sides, the ble connection will be establised automaticlly.
